**Work with us**

I'd really like the opportunity to tell the world about all the important work you are doing.

A correspondent at a national, multimedia organisation recently told me: "Most firms don't know how to do PR, even those with PR people." He then broadcast my clients' story where up to 10 million people could see it.

If my clients had paid for the coverage I secured for them last year it would have cost them Â£2 million in equivalent advertising fees.

This included 30 features in the national press naming my clients and focusing on their activities. 

My team and I work with journalists to place impactful national news stories. So whether you need a one-off media placement or a full-blown public relations strategy, we can raise awareness of your company, charity, spokesperson or issue.

If you would like to know how we could secure meaningful press coverage for you please contact me on 07980 649 501\.
