Ryan Hooper, Press Association:

"I have worked with Kirsty on several high-profile yet sensitive cases over the last two years which have resulted in nation-wide exposure for her clients and their issues.

"Her knowledge of how the media works in the 21st century - and, crucially, her dedication to ensuring her clients are prepped and comfortable with the interview process - has made working with Kirsty a real pleasure.

"I can be confident that the clients Kirsty puts forward for interview - often to talk about complicated matters of law or deeply personal subjects - will present well when faced with a journalist's questions

A freelance documentary maker: 

"Kirsty has a journalist's nose for a story: she knows what will make audiences sit up and listen, and how to engage with the media so they can produce the best possible coverage. Efficient and organised, Kirsty has always been a pleasure to work with."
