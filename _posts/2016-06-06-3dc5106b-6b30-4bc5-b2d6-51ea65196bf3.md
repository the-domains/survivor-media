Independent newspaper exclusive - first woman portrait

The first woman scholar to have a portrait displayed at Rhodes House, Oxford College. This was a complicated piece because the sheer number of people the client wanted to be mentioned - the woman in the portrait, the funders, the charity, the artist, the young woman who lobbied and the Chair of the charity. These all appeared in the print version of the article, which took up almost a full page.
