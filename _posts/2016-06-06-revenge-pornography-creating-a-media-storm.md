Revenge Pornography - creating a media storm

I helped finalise a documentary about the first civil claim to be made against a perpetrator of revenge pornography for the Guardian website; collaborating with the video journalist to ensure the story achieved high profile national press coverage. I was very lucky to get to work with Youtuber Chrissy Chambers to secure publicity on this important issue on several occasions. A few examples of the coverage achieved are below.
